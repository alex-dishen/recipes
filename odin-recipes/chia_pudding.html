    <h1>Chia Coconut Pudding with Coconut Milk</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chia seed pudding with coconut milk is a healthy alternative
        to processed desserts. Chia seeds make great desserts and are high in
        omega-3s. This recipe uses agave (or stevia, if you prefer) as a
        sweetener instead of sugar. Stir again before serving and top with
        fresh fruit and another dash of cinnamon or spices.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups sweetened coconut milk</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsweetened coconut milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon agave nectar, or more to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>½ cup chia seeds</li>
            <li>½ cup diced fresh strawberries (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together sweetened and unsweetened coconut milks,
                agave nectar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl;
                stir in chia seeds. Allow mixture to soak until thickened,
                at least 20 minutes, or cover the bowl with plastic wrap and
                refrigerate overnight.</li>
